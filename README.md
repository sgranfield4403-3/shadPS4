[Check us on twitter](https://twitter.com/shadps4 "Check us on twitter")

# Status

Currently it can only load PS4 ELF files . 

![](https://geps.dev/progress/60) Elf Loader

![](https://geps.dev/progress/20) Logging system

![](https://geps.dev/progress/5) Everything else

# Why?

The project started as a fun project. Due to short amount of free time probably it will take a while since it will be able to run something decent but I am trying to do regular small commits.

# Build 

Project is using cmake files. To build, Visual Studio 2022 is enough
