![](https://geps.dev/progress/20) Logging system

![](https://geps.dev/progress/5) Everything else

# Why?

The project started as a fan project. Due to short amount of free time probably it will take a while since it will be able to run something decent but i am trying to do regular small commits.

# Build 

Project is using cmake files. To build .Atm vstudio 2022 is enough
