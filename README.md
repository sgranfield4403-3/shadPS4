# shadPS4

An early PS4 emulator for Windows and Linux written in C++
by shadow , skmp , wheremyfoodat , GPUCode

# Status

Early progress , a small amount of ps4 sdk demos and homebrew games working

# Why?

The project started as a fun project. Due to short free time, it will probably take a while since it will be able to run something decent, but I am trying to do regular small commits.
