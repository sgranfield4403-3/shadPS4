1.Intro
=======
shadPS4 is a ps4 emulator for windows. Although atm it can't run a lot of stuff , it can emulate perfectly videoout_basic demo from ps4 sdk. Since developing focused on that , don't expect to run anything else atm (ok maybe if you are extreme lucky , you might find something else that works)

2.Current status
================
shadps4 is a HLE emulator . Currently on a small amount of functions is emulated , which is one of the reasons compatibility is low.
